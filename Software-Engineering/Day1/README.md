## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

+ **What is Software Engineering?**  
  Software engineering is the application of systematic principles, methods, and tools to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems. It is crucial in the technology industry as it ensures reliability, scalability, and efficiency in building complex software solutions.

+ **Key Milestones in Software Engineering:**  
  1. **1968 NATO Conference:** Coined the term "software engineering" to address the software crisis.  
  2. **Development of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Revolutionized modular software design in the 1980s.  
  3. **Agile Manifesto (2001):** Promoted iterative, collaborative, and customer-centric software development.

+ **Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):**  
  1. **Planning:** Define objectives and scope.  
  2. **Analysis:** Gather and document requirements.  
  3. **Design:** Architect the solution and plan components.  
  4. **Implementation:** Develop and code the solution.  
  5. **Testing:** Verify functionality and fix defects.  
  6. **Deployment:** Deliver the final product.  
  7. **Maintenance:** Monitor and enhance the software.

+ **Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies:**  
  - **Waterfall:** Sequential, structured, suitable for well-defined projects (e.g., building safety-critical systems).  
  - **Agile:** Iterative, flexible, ideal for projects with changing requirements (e.g., mobile app development).  

+ **Roles and Responsibilities:**  
  - **Software Developer:** Writes code, implements features, and fixes bugs.  
  - **Quality Assurance Engineer:** Tests software for defects and ensures quality standards.  
  - **Project Manager:** Plans, coordinates, and monitors project progress to meet deadlines and objectives.

+ **Importance of IDEs and VCS:**  
  - **IDEs (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ):** Provide tools like syntax highlighting and debugging for efficient development.  
  - **VCS (e.g., Git):** Tracks changes, enables collaboration, and ensures version control of code.

+ **Common Challenges and Strategies:**  
  1. **Keeping up with technology:** Stay updated through continuous learning.  
  2. **Communication gaps:** Use tools like Slack and hold regular meetings.  
  3. **Debugging complex issues:** Adopt systematic debugging practices and use monitoring tools.

+ **Types of Testing:**  
  1. **Unit Testing:** Validates individual components (e.g., functions).  
  2. **Integration Testing:** Ensures modules work together correctly.  
  3. **System Testing:** Verifies the entire system meets requirements.  
  4. **Acceptance Testing:** Confirms the system satisfies end-user needs.

## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

+ **What is Prompt Engineering?**  
  Prompt engineering is the craft of designing precise and effective input prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant outputs.

+ **Example of Improving a Prompt:**  
  - **Vague Prompt:** "Explain something about coding."  
  - **Improved Prompt:** "Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in Python with examples of classes and inheritance."  
  - **Why Effective:** The improved prompt specifies the topic, language, and expected details, making the AI's response more targeted and useful.
